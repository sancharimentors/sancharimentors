Dear Team,

We have a unique opportunity to make a lasting impact on the lives of deprived children in slums. With our collective expertise in training, social skills development, professional English speaking, basic language skills, maths, history, and computers, we can mentor these children and help them unlock their potential.

To achieve this, we need to organize our efforts effectively, especially since we operate from different countries and regions. Here’s a plan to get started and maintain momentum:

Platform and Communication:

GitHub Pages: We'll create a free website hosted on GitHub Pages to keep track of our progress. Access will be restricted to our team members.
Communication Tools: Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams for regular communication and updates.
Details to Collect:

Child Information: Name, age, educational background, interests, and areas needing improvement.
Mentor Information: Areas of expertise, availability, and contact information.
Parental/Guardian Consent: Ensure we have permission to mentor and track progress.
Syllabus and Curriculum Development:

Needs Assessment: Conduct an initial assessment to understand the specific needs of the children.
Custom Curriculum: Develop a curriculum based on the assessment. It should cover basic language skills, maths, history, computers, social skills, and professional English speaking.
Flexible Modules: Create flexible modules that can be adapted to individual learning speeds and needs.
Tracking Progress:

Learning Management System (LMS): Integrate a simple LMS on our GitHub Pages site to upload materials, assignments, and track progress.
Progress Reports: Regularly update each child’s progress, including completed modules, strengths, and areas needing further support.
Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with periodic assessments and reviews to adjust the curriculum as needed.
Regular Meetings and Updates:

Weekly/Monthly Check-ins: Schedule regular virtual meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
Shared Calendar: Maintain a shared calendar for deadlines, meetings, and milestones.
By working together and leveraging technology, we can ensure that these children receive the mentorship and education they deserve. Let's make a difference, one child at a time.
